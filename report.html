        Nowadays with the constant evolution of technology, people have become
        lighter targets of online information thieves and card cloning.

      <h3>
         <span> 2.</span>Introduction
      </h3>
      <p>
        I tried to create a site that will present the basic concept that a reader will need to study in order to undersand some of the concepts used to improve online security.

      <h3 > <span> 3.</span>Homework's Requirements</h3>

      <p>
        For this HCI homework I was supposed to design and implement a graphic
        interface for my graduation thesis. My license consists in the analysis
        and research of the different methods by which destructive security can
        be obtained. I chose to focus on the physically unclonable
        functions,also known as PUFs, radio frequency identification systems or
        RFIDs and a combination between these two called P.U.F based R.F.I.D.
      </p>

<section role="contentinfo" id="pages">
<section role="contentinfo" id="mainpage">
      <h4> <span> 4.1.</span>Main Page</h4>
      <p>
        The main page has a simple design,it doesn't provide any information
        about the topic, but in order to get the attention of the reader I
        placed a motto in the middle of the page,inside a half of a pyramid
        "Never two of the same",hoping that it will arouse curiosity and make
        users acces one of the pages that actually contains information about
        this topic.Also,the motto summarizes the idea of the PUFs, that we can
        not clone an instance. To acces other pages the user only needs to
        choose the topic and click it from the navigation-bar.Additionally,I
        wanted to give the site a name,so I chose "UNIK", which is the Norwegian
        word for "unique". Also when I designed the logo I tried to recreate the
        name of the site, using some of the old Norwegian runes.
      </p>

<section role="contentinfo" id="puf">
      <h4> <span> 4.2</span>PUF Page</h4>
      <p>
        The page dedicated to the PUF description consists of 9 cards shaped
        like a hexagon,each one containing a title and suitable information for
        that category.For example the first card from the first row, has the
        title "Definition" and presents a basic definiton of the PUF concept,but
        when the users hovers over the card it flips and on the back of it the
        user can see a more formal definiton of the concept. The others cards
        presents the properties of a PUF,types of PUFs and also the description
        of some of the most used PUFs.
      </p>
    </section>   
    
    <section role="contentinfo" id="rfid">
      <h4> <span> 4.3</span>RFID Page</h4>
      <p>
        The page that presents the RFID systems maintains the same design as the
        PUF page, 9 hexagonal cards that provide the basic information that the
        users need in order to understand this concept. Even though the design
        may be the same, there are different information categories.For example,
        in order to get acquainted to the topic, a user needs to understand what
        an RFID system is made of and also what are the categories of security
        models. These kind of information being presented on the cards.
      </p>

      <section role="contentinfo" id="puf-rfid">
      <h4>  <span> 4.4</span> PUF based RFID</h4>
      <p>
        The last page,dedicated to the combination between PUFs and
        RFIDs,follows the same idea of design. In order to understand this
        concept of PUF based RFID,a reader must first visit the other two pages
        otherwise the chances of him understanding what is being explained are
        pretty low.In others words, the page presents information on when such a
        combination is best used and what type of tag corruption exists.

<section role="contentinfo" id="tech">
      <h4>  <span>5.</span>Used Technologies</h4>
      <p>
        In terms of techologies, I didn't use a framework like Angular or React,
        I didn't want to rely on creating components, because I considered that
        the site I wanted can be obtained using only Vanilla. As I mentioned
        before the design of the application is pretty simple,there are not too
        many pages because I still have 2 chapters to finish, and it could be
        created using basic HTML and CSS code, I didn't think that I will need
        to use extra markups or class attributes to attain a layout.
